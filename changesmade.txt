1. Created a new repo on GiotHub and called it basic_repo.
2. Created a local repository also called basic_repo.

	cd basic_repo
	git init
3. Created some files inside my local repo and added some content to them

4. Added, commited, and pushed these changes to GitHub
	git add branching.txt
	git add merging.txt
	git commit -m "initial commit"
